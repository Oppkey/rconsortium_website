<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/bridging-the-real-time-gap-how-inwt-is-bringing-apache-kafka-to-the-r-ecosystem/Andreas.png" class="img-fluid" style="width:50.0%"></p>
<p>In a recent interview with the R Consortium, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreas-neudecker-457946208/">Andreas Neudecker</a>, solution architect at INWT, a data and analytics company located in Berlin, Germany, shared insights into the motivation behind developing an Apache Kafka client for R and the challenges it aims to address within the R ecosystem. His company frequently builds models in both R and Python, often encountering the need for real-time data analytics from Kafka clusters. When a real-time fraud detection project required connecting to a Kafka cluster, the lack of a stable Kafka client for R forced them to switch to Python despite having an R-based model ready to go. This experience highlighted the gap in R’s real-time data processing capabilities. It inspired Andreas to develop a Kafka client for R, making it easier to access real-time data sources and potentially leveling the playing field with Python.</p>
<p>To get started using kafka right away, please reference this article by Andreas titled “<a href="https://www.inwt-statistics.com/blog/r-package-kafka">Introducing the kafka R Package</a>,” which covers an example to demonstrate how kafka works.</p>
<p>GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/INWTlab/r-kafka">https://github.com/INWTlab/r-kafka</a></p>
<p>Installation from GitHub:</p>
<pre><code>remotes::install_github("inwtlab/r-kafka")</code></pre>
<p>This ISC project was funded by the R Consortium.</p>
<p><strong>What motivated you to develop a Kafka client for R, and what specific challenges in the R ecosystem are you aiming to address with this project?</strong></p>
<p>We typically build models in both R and Python, depending on our customers’ needs and preferences. Each language has different types of models available, so the choice between R and Python depends on the specific requirements. We handle both traditional batch processing and real-time analytics for our clients.</p>
<p>Many of our customers use Kafka clusters for their real-time data. At one point, we faced a challenge where we needed to perform real-time analytics, but the data was stored in a Kafka cluster. The question became: how do we connect to the Kafka cluster?</p>
<p>To be more specific, we had a real-time fraud detection project where we needed to identify fraudulent patterns in a stream of transactions. We already had a model in R, and our initial plan was to continue using it to keep costs down. However, we realized there was no stable Kafka client available for R at the time. So, we were essentially forced to switch to Python to consume the data from Kafka, which wasn’t our preferred choice.</p>
<p>In the end, we developed a solution by having a Python consumer write data into an in-memory cache database, which allowed us to continue using our existing R model. The R process accessed the data from this cache database. This experience made it clear to us that having a Kafka client for R would have made the process much smoother. We’ve also heard from other companies who made the same choice—they opted for Python over R simply because Python had a Kafka client, and R didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>Could you explain how the R Kafka client will enhance real-time data analysis and processing capabilities within the R environment?</strong></p>
<p>In many cases, there are solid reasons to train models in R. For example, some specific models are available in R that haven’t been developed in Python yet. Personally, I also find that I can develop much faster in R—it typically takes me less time to get a running prototype compared to Python.</p>
<p>What I’ve noticed is that R is often used more for traditional batch processing or modeling, but there’s no real reason why it shouldn’t also be used for real-time applications. I believe that having a Kafka client for R could be a missing piece of the puzzle, making it easier to access real-time data sources.</p>
<p><strong>How does the proposed solution compare to existing alternatives, such as using Python for Kafka communication in data pipelines?</strong></p>
<p>It should essentially work the same way as it does in Python, since we’re using the same underlying C library. While we’re still in the early stages and don’t have all the capabilities of the Python client yet, the experience should feel pretty similar because of this shared foundation.</p>
<p><strong>What were the key insights from your initial benchmarking of the prototype, and how do they inform the project’s development goals?</strong></p>
<p>First, we created a proof of concept (PoC), which showed us that it’s definitely possible to write a proper Kafka client for R using the C library. As we moved on to building the first minimum viable product (MVP), we also did some basic benchmarking. The results showed that we were a bit slower than the Python client. To give you some numbers, we could consume or produce 1 million messages in about 20 seconds, while Python handled it in 10 seconds, so Python was faster in this case.</p>
<p>However, I believe we could improve this with a better interface or some optimizations. That said, even with these numbers, the speed difference shouldn’t have a major impact in most real-world applications, because it’s not just about reading the data—it also involves processing, which takes additional time. So, even though the client isn’t quite as fast as Python’s, it’s still sufficient for most use cases.</p>
<p><strong>What is the significance of the Admin Client functionalities in managing Kafka infrastructure, and how do you plan to implement these within the R package?</strong></p>
<p>Right now, our client can handle the essential tasks of sending and receiving data. However, it would be great to add the ability to create and delete topics directly within R, as well as manage consumer group offsets. These are likely the most important additional features we need.</p>
<p>We plan to implement this in a way similar to how the Python Confluent package does it—by creating a separate class for admin tasks. Since the underlying functionality already exists in the C++ package, the process should be straightforward. We just need to create wrapper functions using <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/index.html">Rcpp</a>, write the documentation, and run the necessary tests, and then it should work as expected.</p>
<p><strong>How has it been working with the R Consortium? Would you recommend applying for an ISC grant to other R developers?</strong></p>
<p>It was a very straightforward and smooth process, with no unnecessary bureaucracy. Overall, it was a great experience, and we had a friendly and helpful contact person throughout. I would definitely recommend it if you have an idea—it’s a really good way to secure funding.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.nshephard.dev/about.html">Neil Shephard</a>, co-organizer of the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/sheffieldr-sheffield-r-users-group/">Sheffield R User Group</a> in Sheffield, United Kingdom (also on <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@sheffieldr">fosstodon</a>), recently spoke to the R Consortium about his journey from Genetic Epidemiology to Research Software Engineering with R. He also discussed the revival of the Sheffield R User group and the challenges of organizing inclusive and hybrid events. Neil also highlighted the group’s successful participation in Hacktoberfest and shared insights into his current R projects, including developing tools for thyroid cancer prediction and deploying Shiny applications.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/reviving-sheffield-r-user-group-and-building-tools-for-thyroid-cancer-prediction/NeilShephard.png" class="img-fluid" style="width:30.0%"></p>
<p><strong>Please share your background and involvement with the RUGS group.</strong></p>
<p>I have a background in biology. I studied zoology and genetics at the undergraduate level and then pursued a master’s degree in genetic epidemiology, focusing on identifying genes involved in human diseases. Specifically, I worked on complex diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and related autoimmune diseases initially and breast cancer. During my master’s program, I was taught programming and learned some C, although that was quite a long time ago, around 25 years ago. While I never really took to C programming, I was also introduced to the statistical package <a href="https://www.stata.com/">Stata</a>, which I found very user-friendly and appreciated its strong community support.</p>
<p>As time passed, I began to hear more and more about R. This was around 2000, a few years after R was first released. One of the things I had started doing was writing literate documents in <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>. I would write a LaTeX document, and Stata could output tables to LaTeX, which I could then include in my document and render to PDF. I found this a much more efficient way to work reproducibly than traditional word processors and spreadsheets.</p>
<p>I was exploring R and discovered Friedrich Liesch’s package <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/utils/doc/Sweave.pdf">Sweave</a>, which interweaved LaTeX and R code. It was really the precursor to RMarkdown. I also started using Linux as my operating system and became interested in the free open source software movement.</p>
<p>Around 2004 I made a conscious choice to switch from Stata to R because of its open source licensing and extensibility. While Stata allowed me to write my functions and modules, I found R more open as it isn’t owned by a company, and I didn’t need a license, which I typically relied on my employers to provide.</p>
<p>I decided to invest my time learning R for all my work because it would benefit me in the long run, as I could take the knowledge and skills and use them anywhere. When I switched careers from genetic statistician to medical statistician in a clinical trials unit at the University of Sheffield, I continued using R, although I was in a minority, as most colleagues at the time used Stata or SPSS.</p>
<p>I continued using R and convinced a few others to join me. We supported each other, and around 2015 the SheffieldR user group was initiated by <a href="https://annakrystalli.me/about/">Anna Krystalli</a>. I attended the meetings and found them really useful as they brought together people from the university and beyond who shared a passion for using R in their research, showing each other how they used R in their work. It was a great way to discover new features. I attended those meetings until around 2019, when I switched jobs to work for a startup tech company and switched to using Python and Java for work. Soon after, SheffieldR fizzled out due to lockdown in 2020.</p>
<p>After working for a tech company for a few years, I returned to the University of Sheffield as a Research Software Engineer, where I’m currently employed. This role has given me more opportunities to use R. I have been involved in a Python project from the beginning, but recently, I’ve also had the chance to work on a few R projects. I’ve missed the enjoyable and exciting R user group meetings that I used to attend.</p>
<p>I was asked to improve Sheffield’s RSE (Research Software Engineering) community. As part of this, I joined the <a href="https://osc-international.com/">open science community movement</a>, an international initiative that began in the Netherlands. They had an incubator program to establish open science communities in local areas, and I enrolled in that program to start an open science community in Sheffield. I’m quite a practical person and like to take action and help others, so I resolved to revive the Sheffield R user group as I had found it so useful in helping me learn what could be done with R earlier in my career.</p>
<p>I briefly worked with Anna, who had started the SheffieldR group, but unfortunately, soon after I started to work with the RSE Team, she <a href="https://www.r-rse.eu/">moved on</a> and became an R consultant. Still, we had some overlap, and she was happy to share all the materials and the <a href="https://github.com/SheffieldR">GitHub</a> repository for the website with me. So, I took on the responsibility of organizing the group. I rewrote the <a href="https://sheffieldr.github.io/">website</a> and switched it from <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">R Markdown</a> to <a href="https://quarto.org/">Quarto</a> to learn more about using Quarto, which had just been released. It wasn’t too difficult since the languages are pretty similar.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/reviving-sheffield-r-user-group-and-building-tools-for-thyroid-cancer-prediction/SheffieldRUGs.png" class="img-fluid"> <em>Sheffield R User Group <a href="https://sheffieldr.github.io/posts/2024-04-22-april-meetup/">April 2024</a> Meetup “Profiling and Optimising your R code,” Speaker: Dan Brady, Research Software Engineer, University of Sheffield.</em></p>
<p>I was joined by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/grace-accad-9776b22b9/">Grace Accad</a> from the Data Analytics Service at the University of Sheffield to organize SheffieldR. She had been involved in R ladies and attended other R user groups, and I’ve been very grateful to her for her support and help in sharing the workload.</p>
<p>We have been hosting Sheffield R user group events for over a year, and they have been quite successful. We aim to hold the events every month during term time. I presented at our initial reboot session showing how to use <a href="https://ns-rse.github.io/SheffieldR-quarto-for-slides/#/title-slide">Quarto and GitHub pages to put slides online</a>, but we have been fortunate to find other speakers since then. However, Grace and I are primarily responsible for organizing and setting up the website and booking rooms. It’s not too demanding, but that’s my primary role in the group.</p>
<p><strong>Can you share what the R community is like in Sheffield? </strong></p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/reviving-sheffield-r-user-group-and-building-tools-for-thyroid-cancer-prediction/SheffieldJanuary2024.png" class="img-fluid"> <em>Sheffield R User Group January 2024 Meetup “<a href="https://sheffieldr.github.io/posts/2024-01-18-jan-meetup/">Automating Health Economic Evaluation with R</a>,” Speaker: Robert Smith, <a href="https://darkpeakanalytics.com/">Dark Peak Analytics</a>.</em></p>
<p>I only have a little industry experience, having only worked for one company. However, I think R is more academic, although that is changing. In Sheffield, the company I worked for had a research department with only two people. So, at least in Sheffield, R is used in the industry. The Sheffield R user group aims to bring together people who use R in the area to create a community where they can ask questions and help each other. A <a href="https://shef-ai.github.io/">data science learning community</a> in Sheffield used to be more R-oriented but now includes people using pandas. I like that community as well.</p>
<p>I strongly believe in the importance of connecting with people in person. The networking effect is natural and very beneficial. Building these connections and networks online while possible is more challenging, so I am focused on creating a local group to foster this. Most participants are from the University of Sheffield. However, there are also individuals from Sheffield Hallam University and outside academia, such as Simon Rolph from the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, who gave an excellent talk on the <a href="https://sheffieldr.github.io/posts/2024-02-15/">targets package</a>. We’ve also had talks with <a href="https://sheffieldr.github.io/posts/2024-01-18-jan-meetup/">Robert Smith and Wael Mohammed</a> of Dark Peak Analytics.</p>
<p>One of my challenges is that I have a daughter, so I usually need to be home in the afternoons to take care of her. I appreciate that attending events in the evenings isn’t possible for everyone. Finding a suitable time for everyone is difficult. If we have meetings at lunchtime, we get a lot of university attendees, but only a few from farther away because they would have to travel. You can please some of the people sometimes, but you can’t please all the people all the time.</p>
<p><strong>Your group recently hosted <a href="https://www.meetup.com/sheffieldr-sheffield-r-users-group/events/?type=past">Hacktoberfest events.</a> Can you share more about the topic covered? Why this topic? </strong></p>
<p>Hacktoberfest celebrates open source software and encourages people to find their favorite open source project to contribute to. Our first meeting was on October 4th, and then we had one every other Friday throughout October.</p>
<p>The main objective was to help people get comfortable contributing to open source software, especially those who use R but may not be familiar with version control using Git and GitHub. In the first session, I used material from my job as a research software engineer, where I’ve been teaching a course Anna developed on using Git and GitHub for the past year or two. This course covers the basics of version control and includes a collaborative exercise using a GitHub repository.</p>
<p>Participants learned how to fork the repository, make changes locally, push their changes, and create pull requests. The following three weeks were dedicated to providing support, where others and I with experience in version control and using R were available to assist others. The goal was for people to help each other during this time and not rely solely on me or my colleagues as organizers, as some individuals may have more knowledge than others. It was great to see everyone coming together to support one another, as some people may have more expertise in specific areas than I do.</p>
<p><strong>Any techniques you recommend using for planning for or during the event? (Github, zoom, other) Can these techniques be used to make your group more inclusive to people that are unable to attend physical events in the future? </strong></p>
<p>I have a GitHub issue template in place to help organize our meetings. I use GitHub to plan events because my memory is terrible. I’d likely forget something important if I didn’t have everything written down. Whenever we plan an event, we create a GitHub issue and assign it to me or Grace. It’s a checklist of tasks such as booking a room, setting dates and times, confirming speakers, obtaining consent for photography during the event, and listing places to advertise the event. This checklist helps us keep track of everything that needs to be done for each event.</p>
<p>The Sheffield R user group used to meet in a local pub. However, when we restarted the events, we decided that using more neutral spaces would be more inclusive, so we use university buildings now. We want to ensure everyone feels welcome, so we choose accessible venues for people with disabilities. It’s important to me that everyone can attend without any barriers.</p>
<p>We also run hybrid meetings, which I find challenging. When I have a group of people in the room, I naturally tend to speak to them. I have to remind myself to pay constant attention to the online participants. It’s helpful to have another organizer keeping an eye on the online side of things when people raise their hands. Despite the challenges, we continue with hybrid meetings because they’re a good way of allowing people to attend if they can’t make it in person.</p>
<p><strong>Please share about a project you are currently working on or have worked on in the past using the R language. Goal/reason, result, anything interesting, especially related to the industry you work in?</strong></p>
<p>I’m working on a project with a PhD student trying to improve thyroid cancer prediction. When he approached me, he used SPSS for his analysis because that’s what one of my old colleagues had taught him. From now on, I encouraged him to switch to using R for all his work, and I’ve helped him set up version control for it.</p>
<p>He has learned to write Quarto documents with embedded R code to write the manuscript he wants to create. This has been very useful. He has also learned how to use a multiple imputation package that he hadn’t used before to summarize the results and check their consistency with the observed data. At one point, the PhD student and his supervisor wanted to create a website where people could enter various characteristics about a patient and receive a risk profile indicating whether the lumps in their thyroids were likely to be malignant. To achieve this, he revisited his knowledge of <a href="https://shiny.posit.co/">Shiny</a> to get the website up and running. However, he was aware that it might be something they wanted to put into production. Consequently, he discovered the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/golem/index.html">Golem</a> package, which appears to be a handy tool for taking Shiny and developing it more rigorously for deployment to production. This has been the main focus of his recent work with R.</p>
<p>I’ve been using Quarto and R for my <a href="https://ns-rse.github.io/">blog</a> and some small tasks lately. I’ve written several posts about <a href="https://pre-commit.com">pre-commit</a> for linting code, which is really useful. I’m overdue writing one on how to use the <a href="https://lintr.r-lib.org/">lintr</a> package and should find time to investigate the newer <a href="https://flint.etiennebacher.com/">flint</a> package too.</p>
<p>I also had a project where the researchers used R and had a lot of code. I convinced them to organize their code into a more structured package format. I found <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html">DevTools</a> and the <a href="https://usethis.r-lib.org/">usethis</a> package to be very helpful for that. At the same time, I set up the package repository to use <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lintr/index.html">linter</a> to ensure that all coding standards were followed in case they ever decided to release it to <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">CRAN</a>.</p>
<p>I feel like a jack of all trades because I use Python, R, and a bit of Bash. I know a little about everything, but I’m not an expert at any one thing!</p>

  <title>Streamlining API Integration: Jon Harmon’s Journey with the api2r Package</title>
  <dc:creator>R Consortium</dc:creator>
  <link>https://r-consortium.org/posts/streamlining-api-integration-jon-harmons-journey-with-the-api2r-package/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The R Consortium recently interviewed <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonthegeek/">Jon Harmon</a>, Principal Data Solutions Engineer at Atorus, about his ISC-funded project, <em>api2r</em>. Jon’s extensive experience working with APIs from platforms like Slack, YouTube, and LinkedIn, along with his leadership of the Data Science Learning Community (DSLC.io), inspired him to develop <em>api2r</em> to simplify the process of wrapping APIs in R. The package streamlines the creation of R packages for various APIs by leveraging the OpenAPI standard, making it easier for developers to integrate external services into their R workflows.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/streamlining-api-integration-jon-harmons-journey-with-the-api2r-package/JonHarmon.png" class="img-fluid" style="width:50.0%"></p>
<p>Jon discusses the challenges he faced during the package’s development, particularly around authentication and endpoint setup, and how <em>api2r</em> differs from other tools like {httr2} and {paws}.</p>
<p>The R Consortium funded this project.</p>
<p><strong>What inspired you to create the api2r package, and how do you envision benefiting the R community?</strong></p>
<p>I run the <a href="dslc.io">Data Science Learning Community (DSLC) at dslc.io</a>, and through that, as well as some paid work, I frequently work with various APIs like Slack, YouTube, Zoom, LinkedIn, and different task management systems. I noticed that most of these are documented using the <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI Specification</a> or an older variant, which made it easier for me to read and write R code for them.</p>
<p>However, I found myself repeatedly looking up how I had done similar tasks before, which made me realize it would be much easier if I created a tool to streamline this process. Since I love writing R packages, it felt natural to pursue this idea.</p>
<p>In terms of how the R community could benefit, I want to make it easier for others to wrap APIs in R so people can create packages for whatever tasks they might need.</p>
<p><strong>Can you elaborate on the challenges you foresee in implementing authentication and endpoint calls in the initial milestone (version 0.1.0)?</strong></p>
<p>I’ve actually moved past the initial milestone of setting up authentication, but it definitely presented—and continues to present—challenges. First, I ended up splitting the package into three parts. There’s <em><a href="https://rapid.api2r.org/">rapid</a></em>, which parses API descriptions into a standard object, <em><a href="https://nectar.api2r.org/">nectar</a></em>, which wraps the <code>httr2</code> package to handle common tasks, and <em><a href="https://beekeeper.api2r.org/">beekeeper</a></em>, which is the main package. <em>Nectar</em> was particularly helpful because I was able to abstract the standard types of authentication into just a few simple wrappers. While <code>httr2</code> handles much of the heavy lifting, it doesn’t guide you through what you need to find in the documentation. That’s where <em>Nectar</em> steps in, helping streamline the setup process.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/streamlining-api-integration-jon-harmons-journey-with-the-api2r-package/beekeeperlogo.png" class="img-fluid" style="width:50.0%"></p>
<p>That said, there are still ongoing challenges. Many sites don’t fully or correctly implement the OpenAPI Specification, making it difficult to find the necessary information. Even when they do, details on how to obtain an API key can be tricky to track down. I spent a lot of time trying to address this issue, although there’s no perfect solution. Fortunately, after I wrote my grant application, a new version of <code>httr2</code> was released that simplifies a lot of these processes, which has been a big help.</p>
<p><strong>How does the api2r package aim to address the inconsistencies and inefficiencies in the current process of wrapping APIs into R packages?</strong></p>
<p>One thing I really wanted to focus on is the challenge of testing packages that wrap APIs. I’ve helped many people navigate this issue, as it’s easy for your package to get rejected from CRAN if the tests are not set up correctly or if they require an internet connection. To address this, I made sure that part of the automatic package building process includes generating a test suite that follows best practices for API testing.</p>
<p>With the <em>Nectar</em> package I mentioned earlier, it simplifies things by abstracting common setups—normally done with something like <code>httr2</code>—down to just what’s necessary, based on the API documentation. This creates a straightforward, one-to-one correspondence between what the API specifies and what you need to do, automatically generating a version of the package that handles this process smoothly.</p>
<p><strong>What are the key differences between the api2r package and other API-related tools like {httr}, {httr2}, and {paws}?</strong></p>
<p><em>Paws</em> is actually a family of packages designed specifically for working with Amazon Web Services (AWS) APIs, which is just one use case. The goal of the <em>API to R</em> family of packages I created is to make it easier to write packages like <em>Paws</em>. Essentially, <em>Paws</em> could be a package you’d create using my tools.</p>
<p>I extensively use <code><em>httr2</em></code> (the updated version of <code><em>httr</em></code>), which helps simplify writing API calls.</p>
<p>However, with <code><em>httr2</em></code>, you still have to manually piece everything together. The idea behind <em>API to R</em> is to take the API documentation and automatically build the <code><em>httr2</em></code> calls for you, eliminating the need to manually complete all the intermediate steps.</p>
<p><strong>How do you plan to engage the R community in the development and testing of the api2r package, and what role do you see for collaboration?</strong></p>
<p>I engage with many members of the R community on social media, primarily through <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@jonthegeek">Mastodon</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonthegeek/">LinkedIn</a>, where I share updates about the packages I’m working on, like <em>API to R</em>. I also maintain websites for these packages, and you can visit <a href="beekeeper.api2r.org">beekeeper.api2r.org</a> to find links to all of them. I keep everything up to date there.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, I run the Data Science Learning Community at dslc.io, which now has over 19,000 members, with 400-500 active weekly. Most of our members are R users, and I regularly keep the group updated. We also host a monthly project club where members present their work, and I’ve presented about this project a few times. I’m also active on other R platforms like the ROpenSci Slack team and various Discord channels.</p>
<p>That being said, I’ve reached a point where I could use some help. I’d love for people to check out the GitHub repositories for these packages and share how they’re using them. If you encounter any bugs or have feedback, let me know. Just last week, I had an interaction on Mastodon where someone was working with a new API and asked if I could help. While we haven’t fully connected yet, I was able to send them the documentation to get started on creating the package and exploring what works and what doesn’t. It’s exciting to see where this could lead!</p>
<p><strong>What are your long-term goals for maintaining and expanding api2r, and how do you plan to ensure its sustainability in the R ecosystem?</strong></p>
<p>I strongly believe in developing everything openly, so the project is available on <a href="https://github.com/jonthegeek/beekeeper/tree/main">GitHub</a> for anyone to explore. You can access it from the website. Since it’s public, people are free to use it however they like. If I don’t take the project in the direction they prefer, they can fork it and work on their own version.</p>
<p>I also work closely with <a href="https://ropensci.org/">rOpenSci</a> and other package developers to ensure that there’s a supportive community to keep things running. That said, if anyone is particularly interested in this package and its goals, I would really welcome an active collaborator or two to help manage and advance it. The standard we’re using—like the object version of the OpenAPI Specification—does evolve, and as APIs update, the package will need to adapt as well. My aim is to keep this project going long-term, and I don’t want it to rely entirely on me. Collaboration would be key to ensuring it grows and stays up to date.</p>
<p><strong>How has it been working with the R Consortium? Would you recommend applying for an ISC grant to other R developers?</strong></p>
<p>The R Consortium has been fantastic to work with—completely reasonable, transparent, and supportive at every step. The challenge for me, however, was that I seriously underestimated how much work this project would require. It wasn’t just about the difficulty; I also ended up going off on tangents that weren’t part of the original plan. Since the grant was milestone-based, there are still some milestones I haven’t reached, and that’s been tough to manage.</p>
<p>I definitely recommend applying for an ISC grant if you’re working on something, but I would advise being very careful with how you structure your proposal. I got a bit stuck in my details, and now I’m at a point where I have to find extra time to work on it. There’s still some grant money left, but not enough to fully cover the remaining work. So, I tend to work on the project when I have a specific use for it and can justify the time.</p>
<p>Overall, having the grant was incredibly helpful in giving me the time and space to explore this package, but it’s something to approach with caution regarding planning and execution.</p>

  <title>ConectaR, Podcasts, and Datathons: How the San Carlos R User Group in Costa Rica is Connecting Latin America’s Data Lovers</title>
  <dc:creator>R Consortium</dc:creator>
  <link>https://r-consortium.org/posts/conectaR-podcasts-and-datathons-san-carlos-r-user-group-in-costa-rica/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fransvandunne/">Frans van Dunné</a>, the organizer of the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/san-carlos-r-user-group/">San Carlos R User Group</a>, recently discussed with the R Consortium the development of the R community in Costa Rica and the broader Latin American (LATAM) region. He also talked about the growth of events such as the ConectaR conference and the success of the <a href="https://www.datalatam.com/">Data Latam podcast</a>, which he co-hosts to delve into data science in Latin America. Additionally, Frans highlighted the challenges of building a data-driven community in a rural area and the creative methods they’ve employed to connect people through R.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/conectaR-podcasts-and-datathons-san-carlos-r-user-group-in-costa-rica/FransvanDunne.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><strong>Please share your background and involvement with the RUGS group.</strong></p>
<p>I have a background in biology, and during my PhD in tropical ecology, I encountered some statistical questions that I needed to solve through programming. That’s when I started learning to program, initially with Perl. Eventually, I discovered that I enjoyed solving data-related problems through programming, and that led me to R. It was around 2001 when I first started programming in R.</p>
<p>Eventually, I married and emigrated to Costa Rica (my wife is Tica). Knowing no one in the area, I started an R User Group to connect with people and navigate the area.</p>
<p>Very soon after arriving in Costa Rica, I established my town’s San Carlos R user group. Initially, we held our meetings in-person, but I soon discovered that some attendees traveled for hours by bus to reach San Carlos. Realizing the impracticality, I decided to move our meetings online, and to my surprise, it worked out well. This change occurred even before the pandemic, and we began to see people from Peru and other distant locations joining our group. San Carlos is a small rural area with a population of around 50,000, so having individuals from different parts of Latin America join us was truly amazing.</p>

<p>We had to stop our online meetings because Meetup informed us that, according to their policy before the pandemic, we wouldn’t be able to use their platform if we didn’t hold physical meetings. The world is different now, but that was the situation back then.</p>
<p><strong>Can you share what the local R community is like in San Carlos? </strong></p>

<p>We collaborated with the University of Costa Rica to organize an event that brought together industry, academia, and citizen science professionals for a conference focused on R. The event is called <a href="https://journal.r-project.org/news/RJ-2019-2-conectaR/">Conecta R</a>. We started in 2019 and held the latest edition this year, <a href="https://www.meetup.com/san-carlos-r-user-group/events/299265414/?eventOrigin=group_events_list">Conecta R 2024</a>. When we started, we wanted to understand R’s current status and usage in the LATAM region. It only confirmed that R is widely used in academia. Most statistics courses have transitioned from licensed software to R. R is also used widely in industry.</p>

<p>At <a href="https://www.ixpantia.com/en/">ixpantia</a>, the company I co-founded, we work with clients in various industries, such as consumer packaged goods, retail, oil and gas, and energy production. Additionally, a significant number of clients utilize our financial services.</p>
<p><strong>Would you like to tell us about your recent events?</strong></p>
<p>We’ve resumed our monthly online meetings for the San Carlos R user group. The meetings now take place on the first Saturday of the month in the morning, and anyone is welcome to join through Meetup.com. Our last meeting was held recently, and it was great to see familiar faces returning.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have a podcast called <a href="https://www.datalatam.com/">Data Latam</a>, which covers topics related to data science, not just R. We aim to release a new episode every month. We run this podcast in parallel with meetings, serving a similar purpose. It’s about providing examples and even role models of professionals working with data to show that you don’t need to be an IT professional or a programmer to work with data.</p>
<p><strong>Please share more about the Data Latam podcast. How did you come up with the idea of starting it? Would you like to highlight a few of your favorite podcasts from this series?</strong></p>
<p>The story behind the Data Latam podcast is funny. The co-host, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/diegohmay/">Diego May</a>, and I met through an R Package I wrote to access data from an open-data platform he had developed. We shared an interest in using data and data science to help the development of LATAM and agreed to start a podcast to get to know each other better. Within two months, we had the first opportunity to start a project, and that is when we founded ixpantia, which brings best practices in data science, data engineering, and data strategy to LATAM.</p>
<p>We have done 110 podcasts to date! It seems like a lot, but we learn so much from every conversation that it hardly feels like an effort. Some of my personal favorites that are related to R include Episode 109 with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/noamross/">Noam Ross</a>, where we talked about <a href="https://ropensci.org/">rOpenSci</a>, episode 98 with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sherlytarazonatocto/?originalSubdomain=pe">Sherly Tarazona</a> about her work and <a href="https://www.meetup.com/es/rladies-lima/">R-Ladies Lima</a>, episode 85 with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tareefk/">Tareef Kawaf</a> from Posit and episode 75 with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaahumada/">Jorge Ahumada</a> about the work they do at <a href="https://www.wildlifeinsights.org/">Wildlife Insights</a>. I could go on, but pointing to the complete list at <a href="http://www.datalatam.com">www.datalatam.com</a> makes more sense. I’m sure there is something for everyone interested in data there.</p>
<p><strong>Do you recommend any techniques for planning for or during the event? (Github, Zoom, other.) Can these techniques be used to make your group more inclusive to people who cannot attend physical events in the future? </strong></p>
<p>Online events are great. I live in a rural area, and attending a physical event, even here in Costa Rica, requires a long three-hour drive to the capital. We have done that and will do it again, but having the option to go online is much more practical and has a broader reach.</p>
<p>When we started our first online meetings, we used Google Hangouts, which would fry my laptop after one hour. These tools have improved so much over the last few years, largely pushed by the boom in remote work during the pandemic. We still like <a href="https://www.zoom.com/">Zoom</a> and its functionality for setting up and executing events, including registration.</p>

<p>We have organized two datathons (similar to a hackathon but focused on data) that were incredibly enjoyable and well-attended. The key to their success was our partnerships. One datathon was organized in collaboration with the Costa Rican government, and the other involved two local universities: The University of Costa Rica (UCR) and the Costa Rica Institute of Technology (TEC). I still meet people who attended these events and have fond memories of them.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/goretty-mendoza-785004322/">Goretty Mendoza</a>, the organizer of the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/rladies-morelia/">R-Ladies Morelia</a>, recently spoke to the R Consortium about her experience with the group and her work using R in molecular biology. Under her guidance, the group has grown into a supportive space for women from diverse fields, focusing on building R skills, sharing knowledge, and fostering collaboration. Goretty is committed to empowering the local R community through online and physical events that encourage learning and networking.</p>

<p><strong><em>Please share about your background and involvement with the RUGS group.</em></strong></p>
<p>I am a PhD student specializing in molecular biology, focusing on endophytic fungi. My work involves high-throughput sequencing, particularly amplicon sequencing, to study microbiomes.</p>
<p>I started using R during my PhD. Initially, I practiced independently through online courses, but then I discovered an R-Ladies community. The group was just starting in my city, so I took the opportunity to join. Attending the meetings helped me overcome my fear of working with R and allowed me to improve my skills. Gradually, I became more involved, and a few months ago, we had the opportunity to hold a face-to-face meeting with some members of our R-Ladies community who live in other cities, thanks to the R Consortium’s grant. I’m sure we returned home more motivated, knowing we all aim to improve our R skills.</p>

<p><strong>Can you share what the local R community is like? </strong></p>
<p>Our local R community is a group of enthusiastic women from various fields. Most of us come from science, mainly mathematics or biology, but we also have members from areas like finance or economics interested in learning R. At the start of each semester, we meet to share our interests and goals for the upcoming months. During our face-to-face meetings, we enjoy coffee and cookies, which create a welcoming atmosphere. A key focus of our group is ensuring that those with more experience in R share their knowledge with new members who are just starting. It creates an environment where everyone can learn and grow together. Our R-community is a great opportunity to get involved, collaborate with other women, and make new friends as we learn.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/endophytes-oaks-and-r-how-r-ladies-morelia-is-cultivating-science-and-community-in-morelia-mexico/r-ladies-morelia-zoom.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><strong>Please share about a project you are working on or have worked on using the R language. What is the goal/reason, result, or anything interesting related to your industry?</strong></p>
<p>I’m pursuing my PhD, and R is a tool I use almost daily. For example, I use R for a project involving the study of endophytic associations in different temperate oak species of Mexico. To this end, we initially explored the functional leaf traits of these oak species, and I had to learn different R packages for this project, such as data manipulation and visualization (e.g., <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/">dplyr</a> and <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">ggplot2</a>). Additionally, I used specialized packages like ‘<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/TPD/index.html">TPD</a>’ to calculate metrics related to functional diversity studies and ‘hypervolume’ to calculate climatic niches.</p>
<p>Our study aimed to determine if a functional niche partitioning between two evolutionary groups of oaks allowed them to coexist. We conducted a functional niche analysis and graphical visualization using R and the packages above. An interesting finding was that the analysis suggested differences in functional similarity among the groups, indicating evidence of functional niche partitioning and resource gradients.</p>
<p>These studies are crucial for conservation efforts and guide the development of management practices supporting temperate forests’ long-term health and resilience.</p>
<p><strong>What resources/techniques do/did you use? (Posit (RStudio), Github, Tidyverse, etc.)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Is this an ongoing project? Please share any details or CTA for who should get involved!</strong></p>
<p>Among the various R packages I used, some are for data manipulation and visualization, such as dplyr and ggplot2, and others more specialized, like TPD for calculating metrics used in functional diversity studies, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/hypervolume/index.html">hypervolume</a> for constructing functional niches, and <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ecospat/index.html">ecospat</a> to calculate climatic niche overlap indices.</p>
<p>We extensively utilized GitHub repositories, ensuring that all the scripts were well-documented to allow others to reproduce the analyses easily. Our ongoing project on endophytic fungi associated with oaks is crucial as a first approximation for understanding the complex interactions between fungi and their host plants.</p>
<p>The concept of hidden diversity is a novel and intriguing area that we are just beginning to explore. For those interested in diving deeper into this field, there are several ways to get involved. You can join professional networks in microbial ecology or engage with the field of computational biology through organizations and online communities. Additionally, participating in conferences, workshops, and collaborations with researchers and professionals in the field offers valuable opportunities to contribute to current research.</p>
<p><strong>What trends do you currently see in R language and your industry? Are there any trends you see developing in the near future?</strong></p>
<p>In metagenomics, one of the key trends is the development of massive datasets generated by next-generation sequencing (NGS). It has enabled a deeper and more detailed analysis of microbial communities and their diversity and functions. In this context, R remains an essential tool for statistical analysis and data visualization with specialized libraries like <a href="https://joey711.github.io/phyloseq/">phyloseq</a> and <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vegan/index.html">vegan</a>.</p>
<p>However, given the complexity of metagenomic data, other programming languages like Python and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">Bash</a> are becoming indispensable. In the near future, the use of interdisciplinary workflows that combine R, Python and Bash will continue to grow, along with the development of more integrated tools to manage large datasets. Additionally, we can expect an increased use of artificial intelligence and machine learning to analyze these data.</p>

  <title>The U.S. Federal Reserve quarterly model in R</title>
  <dc:creator>Guest Blog Post</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><em>Guest Post contributed by Andrea Luciani, Bank of Italy, Directorate General for Economics, Statistics and Research, maintainer of the <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=bimets">bimets</a> package (Time Series and Econometric Modeling) in CRAN</em></p>
<p>The US Federal Reserve’s econometric model for the US economy (i.e., FRB/US) is publicly available at <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/us-models-about.htm">federalreserve.gov</a>. The website states, <em>“FRB/US is a large-scale estimated general equilibrium model of the US economy that was developed at the Federal Reserve Board, where it has been in use since 1996 for forecasting, analysis of policy options, and research projects.”</em></p>
<p>FRB/US is a quarterly model with hundreds of equations and variables. The model definition and time series data are available for download on the Federal Reserve website, as is the source code, which allows users to perform several econometric exercises. However, the Federal Reserve publicly distributes source codes only for EViews™ and python.</p>
<p>In this post, we show how to load the FRB/US model, and perform in R the same econometric exercises provided by the Federal Reserve.</p>
<section id="the-frbus-model" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-frbus-model">The FRB/US model</h2>
<p>The Federal Reserve website also states, <em>“Compared with DSGE models, however, FRB/US applies optimization theory more flexibly, which permits its equations to better capture patterns in historical data and facilitates modeling the economy in greater detail… A distinctive feature of FRB/US is its ability to switch between alternative assumptions about how economic agents form expectations. Under the VAR-based option, expectations are derived from the average historical dynamics of the economy as manifested in the predictions of estimated VAR models. Under model-consistent (MC), agents are assumed to form accurate expectations of future outcomes as generated by simulations of FRB/US itself.”</em></p>
<p>FRB/US is a quarterly model, and counts 284 equations and 365 variables (Feb.&nbsp;2024 version). The XML model definition is available for download on the Federal Reserve website, and contains, for each endogenous variable, the following information: the variable name, the variable definition with a short description, the economic sector the variable belongs to, the related equation in both EViews™ and python format, coefficients and exogenous variables involved in the equation.</p>
<p>64 endogenous variables are marked as stochastic and, during the stochastic simulation exercise, will be transformed by applying sequences of shocks as drawn randomly from their historical residuals.</p>
<p>14 endogenous variables belong to the MCE group (i.e., Model-Consistent Expectations) and have an alternative equation that contains forward-looking references.</p>
<p>Finally, at the end of the XML model definition, users can find additional information on economic sectors and exogenous variables involved in the model definition.</p>

  <title>Empowering Dengue Research Through the Dengue Data Hub: R Consortium Funded Initiative</title>
  <dc:creator>R Consortium</dc:creator>
  <link>https://r-consortium.org/posts/empowering-dengue-research-through-the-dengue-data-hub/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/empowering-dengue-research-through-the-dengue-data-hub/DengueDataHub.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/thiyangt/denguedatahub">Dengue Data Hub</a>, an ambitious initiative funded by the R Consortium ISC, transforms how researchers access and utilize dengue-related data. At its core, the Dengue Data Hub aims to provide a centralized repository for dengue incidence, mortality, and risk-related data, streamlining the research process and empowering scientific inquiry into this global health issue. The platform offers easy access through the denguedatahub R package, a Shiny app, and an informative website, making data analysis more efficient and accessible.</p>
<p>Please note: <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/denguedatahub/index.html">denguedatahub version 2.1.1</a> was published on CRAN on Sep 22, 2024.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thiyanga-talagala-24bb63134/">Dr.&nbsp;Thiyanga Talagala</a>, a Senior Lecturer at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura in Sri Lanka, spearheads this initiative. With a PhD from Monash University, where she honed her skills in R programming and data science, Dr.&nbsp;Talagala is deeply passionate about leveraging her expertise to address Sri Lanka’s public health challenges, particularly dengue. Together with her sister, Dr.&nbsp;Priyanga Talagala, she co-founded the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/rladies-colombo/">R-Ladies Colombo group</a> and has been instrumental in bringing innovative solutions to the scientific community. Dr.&nbsp;Talagala’s commitment to enhancing dengue research through accessible data resources is central to her ongoing work, making the Dengue Data Hub a vital tool for researchers worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us about your background and how it connects to the Dengue Data Hub project</strong></p>
<p>Currently, I am working as a Senior Lecturer, Department of Statistics, Faculty of Applied Sciences, University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Sri Lanka. I earned my PhD from Monash University, Australia. During my time at Monash University in Australia, I was part of the NUMBAT research group, where I developed a deep interest in the R programming language and discovered its incredible potential for data analysis and research. I also had the opportunity to meet and collaborate with leading experts in the field, which further fueled my passion for R and data science. I also got to know about the R Ladies community, and I attended events organized by R-Ladies Melbourne.</p>
<p>Once I returned to Sri Lanka after completing my PhD, I felt a strong desire to contribute to my country using the knowledge I had gained. I, along with my Sister, Dr Priyanga Dilini Talagala (we both did our PhDs together at Monash University), established the R Ladies Colombo meetup group.</p>
<p>Dengue is a major public health issue in Sri Lanka. As a data scientist, I can contribute to its mitigation by establishing a centralized repository for dengue data for data analysis and modeling, which empowers dengue research. This project was funded by <a href="https://r-consortium.org/all-projects/2022-group-1.html#dengue-data-hub">R Consortium ISC 2022 - 1 Grant</a> and I have been working on it since 2022.</p>
<p><strong>What is the Dengue Data Hub?</strong></p>
<p>The Dengue Data Hub is a centralized repository that provides access to a variety of data sets related to dengue incidence and other relevant factors. This includes data on dengue deaths, reported cases, indigenous cases, local cases, dengue serotypes, breeding sites, and country-wise levels of risk. I have data related to annual dengue incidence for 195 countries around the world.</p>
<p><strong>Why is this project important for the research community?</strong></p>
<p>Dengue researchers often spend their valuable time searching for datasets, web scraping and cleaning data. The publication of data in a centralized repository helps to prevent duplicate efforts. The dengue data hub enables the community to focus on analysis and modeling rather than data collection and cleaning. Additionally, it enhances research sustainability by allowing researchers to utilize data for their studies while preserving it for future researchers.</p>
<p><strong>How do researchers use the Dengue Data Hub?</strong></p>
<p>There are three straightforward ways for anyone to participate. Use the denguedatahub R software package, use the Dengue Data Hub Shiny app (for non-programmers), or use our website which provides tutorials and examples.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Use the denguedatahub R software package.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/empowering-dengue-research-through-the-dengue-data-hub/denguedatahub-package.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The denguedatahub R package allows researchers to download dengue-related data easily. For Sri Lanka, it includes web scraping functions that directly retrieve weekly epidemiological reports published by the Epidemiology Unit, Ministry of Health, Sri Lanka. This functionality also cleans the data into a tidy format. Additionally, the package offers various data manipulation functions tailored for dengue data visualization and modeling. You can find the package on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/thiyangt/denguedatahub">https://github.com/thiyangt/denguedatahub</a>.</p>

<li>Website (<a href="https://denguedatahub.netlify.app/">https://denguedatahub.netlify.app/</a>)</li>
</ol>
<p>This website is the home for the projects. It provides tutorials and examples. The site was developed using Quarto.</p>
<p><strong>What impact do you hope the Dengue Data Hub will have?</strong></p>
<p>My hope is that the Dengue Data Hub will become a go-to resource for dengue researchers globally. I believe the hub will accelerate dengue research and discoveries which will help in developing effective strategies to combat dengue. The dengue data hub also serves as a</p>
<p>teaching tool for data science and statistics, as it includes comprehensive data sets.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any final thoughts or messages you’d like to share with the research community?</strong></p>
<p>I invite dengue researchers worldwide to collaborate on this project. I do not have access to clinical trial data, so contributions in that area would be especially valuable. We are looking to expand the datasets available, as comprehensive data sharing is essential for advancing our collective understanding of dengue epidemiology. Additionally, we welcome contributions of data, analytical tools, and insights that can help strengthen the hub’s capacity to serve as a central resource for researchers globally.</p>
<p>You can learn more about how to collaborate <a href="https://denguedatahub.netlify.app/collaborate.html">here.</a> We can build a stronger network to enhance dengue research and response efforts worldwide.</p>

<p>The R Consortium talked with Daniel Sabanés Bové, R/Pharma organizer, co-chair of openstatsware.org, co-founder of RCONIS, a biostatistics consulting and software engineering firm, (co-)author of multiple R packages published on CRAN and Bioconductor, and author of the book “Likelihood and Bayesian Inference: With Applications in Biology and Medicine.” Daniel is giving a 3-hour workshop on October 27 with Joe Zhu (Roche) on “Good Software Engineering Practice for R Packages,” and introducing openstatsware in a talk on 31 October.</p>
<p>We talked to Daniel to find out more about the new APAC track.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-is-rpharma-adding-an-apac-track-now">Why is R/Pharma adding an APAC track now?</h3>
<p>Last year, I was on an extended business trip for Roche for 6 weeks in Shanghai. I was fortunate to attend the first China Pharma R User Group (RUG) Meeting in March 2023, so I have seen how active the community is. I also found out how tough it can be to be based in Asia - you just don’t get enough sleep working with colleagues in Europe and North America!</p>
<p>So when the R/Pharma program committee reported that they have been approached by colleagues in Asia about organizing events in their time zone or region, I used the opportunity of my upcoming move to Taipei mid 2024 to propose organizing a dedicated track in the Asia-Pacific timezones.</p>
<p>The R/Pharma APAC track is designed specifically to help avoid time zone burnout, as well as to foster the APAC regional community.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-does-adoption-of-r-in-pharma-in-apac-differ-from-other-parts-of-the-world">How does adoption of R in Pharma in APAC differ from other parts of the world?</h3>
<p>This is not based on robust data, but from a personal perspective I have noticed one key feature is that biotech and Pharma companies in Asia are concentrated in a few hubs, there is Shanghai, Tokyo, and not too many more. Having said that, I have noticed the rise of Contract Research Organizations (CROs) e.g.&nbsp;in India that are starting to use R - the CROs are catching up. Compare that to Europe and the United States, with a wide range of Pharma companies and organizations spread around many different locations. This also influences the adoption of R and open source technologies in general.</p>

<p>The R Consortium is excited to announce that, on September 20, 2024, the R Submissions Working Group successfully submitted its latest test submission package—featuring a WebAssembly component—through the FDA’s Electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD) gateway! This marks a significant milestone as the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) staff has officially received the submission package.</p>
<p>Statistician Eric Nantz at pharmaceuticals company Eli Lilly in Indianapolis, Indiana, says that using WebAssembly “will minimize, from the reviewer’s perspective, many of the steps that they had to take to get the application running on their machines.”</p>
<p>The complete set of submission materials is available publicly on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot4-webR-to-fda">R Consortium Submissions Pilot 4.</a></p>
<section id="about-the-pilot-4-project" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="about-the-pilot-4-project">About the Pilot 4 Project</h2>
<p>The objective of the R Consortium R submission <em>Pilot 4 </em>Project is to explore the use of novel technologies such as Linux containers and WebAssembly to bundle a Shiny application into a self-contained package, facilitating a smoother process of both transferring and executing the application. The application was built using the source data sets and analyses contained in the R submission <em>Pilot 1-3</em>. To our knowledge, this is the first publicly available submission package that includes a WebAssembly component. We hope this submission package and what we have learned can serve as a good reference for future regulatory submission efforts. The WebAssembly technology compiles applications into a portable, consistent environment driven by a web browser, allowing agency reviewers to easily run and evaluate software without complex setups. The second half of the Pilot 4 Project (leveraging container technology to package a Shiny application) will be submitted as an additional package later this year. Additional agency feedback will be shared in future communications.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="about-the-r-submissions-working-group">About the R Submissions Working Group</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-wg/">R Consortium R Submissions Working Group</a> is focused on improving practices for R-based clinical trial regulatory submissions.</p>
<p>Health authority agencies from different countries require electronic submission of data, computer programs, and relevant documentation to bring an experimental clinical product to market. In the past, submissions have mainly been based on the SAS language.</p>
<p>In recent years, the use of open source languages, especially the R language, has become very popular in the pharmaceutical industry and research institutions. Although the health authorities accept submissions based on open source programming languages, sponsors may be hesitant to conduct submissions using open source languages due to a lack of working examples.</p>
<p>Therefore, the R Submissions Working Group aims to provide R-based submission examples and identify potential gaps while submitting these example packages. All materials, including submission examples and communications, are publicly available on the <a href="https://github.com/RConsortium">R consortium GitHub page.</a></p>

  <title>Cakes, Code, and Community: Rasmus Bååth’s Secret to Reviving the CopenhagenR UseR Group</title>
  <dc:creator>R Consortium</dc:creator>
  <link>https://r-consortium.org/posts/cakes-code-and-community-reviving-the-copenhagenr-user-group/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rasmus-baath/">Rasmus Bååth</a>, the organizer of the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/copenhagenr-user-group/">CopenhagenR UseR Group</a>, recently spoke to the R Consortium about his experience in organizing the group. After joining the Copenhagen R User Group in 2013, he took the lead in reviving the group in 2023 after a period of inactivity. Under his guidance, the group now focuses on industry-related topics, personal projects, and emerging tools like Quarto. Rasmus is dedicated to fostering a vibrant local R community through in-person meetups that encourage learning and collaboration.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/cakes-code-and-community-reviving-the-copenhagenr-user-group/rasmus-baath.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The CopenhagenR UseR Group is hosting an exciting “<a href="https://www.meetup.com/copenhagenr-user-group/events/303309816/">Two Tools for Report Generation in R</a>” event on October 3, 2024. The event will feature two presentations on using Sweave and Quarto for report generation, followed by discussions and networking at <a href="https://www.prosa.dk/">PROSA</a>, København, Denmark.</p>
<p><strong>Please share your background and involvement with the RUGS group.</strong></p>
<p>I currently work as a Data Science Manager at Normative.io. I’ve used R on and off for about 15 or 16 years. It all started when I was doing my bachelor’s in academia and needed to plot a histogram. At that time, plotting a histogram in Excel wasn’t easy, so my supervisor suggested trying out R. I gave it a shot and got hooked. After that, I pursued a PhD in cognitive science, where I used R extensively for statistical analysis.</p>
<p>I used R for a lot of graphing during my academic years. After academia, I became a data scientist in the industry, and R was my preferred tool. I work with R and Python, depending on the job’s requirements. In 2013, there were no R meetups in the south of Sweden where I live. I found out about an R meetup in Copenhagen and decided to attend. There, I met <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kennethrose82/">Kenneth Rose</a>, the organizer, who was full of energy and charisma. It was a fun group, so I started attending regularly despite the commute from Sweden to Copenhagen. Kenneth was very active and enthusiastic in running the meetup group.</p>
<p>After a couple of years, the group’s activity declined. A new organizer revived the group, but COVID hit, ending the meetups. The group had been around for ten years by 2023, and I felt it was a shame to let it die. I decided to restart it, and now we have a small but active group. We enjoy discussing industry-related topics and personal projects.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/cakes-code-and-community-reviving-the-copenhagenr-user-group/copenhangenr-meetup.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><strong>Can you share what the local R community is like?</strong></p>
<p>It is the Copenhagen meetup group located in Denmark. However, I can speak for Denmark and Sweden since I live in Sweden. R is widely used in academia and is considered the language of choice for statistics. Python is more prevalent in the industry due to the large number of programmers who are familiar with the language. In Denmark, the pharmaceutical industry is significant. R is still widely used there due to its close ties to academia and the specific requirements for reporting, statistics, and visualization, in which R excels.</p>
<p><strong>Do you guys host online or in-person events?</strong></p>
<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, we tried some online events, but creating a sense of community online with so much content is challenging. I believe online events are great, and people should consider them. However, we also recognize the need for in-person events. For those unable to attend, there is plenty of valuable content online. We don’t have the setup to record events, but we would consider doing so if feasible.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/cakes-code-and-community-reviving-the-copenhagenr-user-group/copenhangenr-meetup2.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><strong>You have a Meetup titled “<a href="https://www.meetup.com/copenhagenr-user-group/events/303309816/">Two tools for report generation in R</a>.” Can you share more on the topic covered? Why this topic?</strong></p>
<p>Our next meetup will focus on automatic reporting in R. We’ll have two speakers: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dperepolkin/">Dmytro Perepolkin</a> and an anonymous speaker. The anonymous speaker will present on <a href="https://rpubs.com/YaRrr/SweaveIntro">Sweave</a>, an older tool used to generate reports in R, while Dmytro will present on <a href="https://quarto.org/">Quarto</a>, a more recent and popular tool for combining R code and text. This meetup will depart from the usual topics, focusing on automatic reporting rather than visualization.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to our upcoming event. It will be a history lesson and a great opportunity to learn about a useful minimalistic tool (Sweave). I’m also excited about Quarto and the potential for new developments. We could have a Quarto meetup every year to stay updated with the latest advancements. The meetup will feature different presentations, including introductions to new tools and discussions about projects and code. It will be a great way to learn and connect with others in the field.</p>
<p><strong>What are some of the popular R-related topics in the group?</strong></p>
<p>The topics we typically cover are where R is at its strongest. We often discuss personal projects, and although I wonder if they receive a great response, I love them. Additionally, we frequently explore new tools and libraries, particularly those related to dashboarding, Shiny, and visualization. Presentations are highly technical, and I’ve noticed that our audience may not be accustomed to text-heavy or math-intensive presentations. Therefore, topics such as statistics and statistics packages might not receive as much attention despite my interest in them. Surprisingly, machine learning is not a common focus at our meetups, as most speakers are more inclined towards visualization, reporting, and statistics rather than machine learning.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/cakes-code-and-community-reviving-the-copenhagenr-user-group/copenhangenr-meetup3.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><strong>Do you recommend any techniques for planning for or during the event? (GitHub, Zoom, other.) Can these techniques be used to make your group more inclusive to people who cannot attend physical events in the future?</strong></p>
<p>There are three key components needed to get started with organizing an event. First, you need people who are interested in attending your event. It can be challenging if you’re in a small town or a location where it’s difficult to attract attendees. Second, you need to secure speakers who are willing to participate. Lastly, finding a suitable venue is crucial. Having a reliable and cost-free location for your event is essential. We were fortunate to secure a free venue through a union for IT workers in Copenhagen, which aligns with our goal of offering free courses without being tied to a specific company.</p>
<p>Finding speakers can be challenging, but constantly contacting and asking for volunteers is the best approach. To make it easier for potential speakers, consider organizing events where multiple speakers can do shorter presentations, which may be less intimidating than a full-hour presentation. However, attracting speakers and attendees remains the most difficult aspect of organizing events. Nevertheless, securing a dependable venue is a great starting point.</p>
<p>And then there are some small things. Make sure to make nice announcements. They need a nice picture. They need friendly text so that people feel welcome. That’s the minimal thing. And the other thing is, if it’s allowed in the meetup space, bring some cakes or cookies and have some snacks. If people know there will be a little bit of snacks, they’re more likely to show up. So it’s a small thing, but I think that helps. This meetup is in Copenhagen, and I’m from Sweden. However, Denmark and Copenhagen have a special relationship with beer. I distinctly remember my first Copenhagen meetup when Kenneth Rose was the organizer. Back then, he brought a big case of beer cans to each meetup, and everyone was having a nice time. I don’t say you need a beer at your meetup, but bringing drinks and snacks is always nice.</p>

  <title>Announcing the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Working Group</title>
  <dc:creator>R Consortium</dc:creator>
  <link>https://r-consortium.org/posts/announcing-health-technology-assessment-HTA-working-group/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The R Consortium is pleased to announce a new Working Group (WG) focused on Health Technology Assessment (HTA). The HTA WG has a mission of promoting the use of R in all aspects of HTA analytics, including both clinical assessment and economic evaluation. It aims to build on the success of other R Consortium working groups in bringing together and promoting dialogue between the broadest range of stakeholders from the HTA ecosystem (industry, HTA bodies, academics and others) to identify needs and address challenges through practical tools and pilot exercises. Health Technology Assessment (HTA) helps decision-makers determine which medical technologies and treatments are effective and worth paying for. It can help ensure that the right treatments reach the right patients at the right time by assessing clinical evidence and economic evaluations to inform policy-making about reimbursement and market access.</p>
<p>Recent policy changes, such as the EU HTA Regulation, require pharmaceutical companies to face stricter standards and shorter deadlines for submitting evidence. At the same time, HTA authorities must review an increasing number of complex analyses under the pressure for timely evidence-based decisions. Lastly, there is pressure on academia to provide easy-to-use HTA software and tools.</p>
<p>Initially, the WG will focus on the following objectives.</p>
<ul>
<li>Foster Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing:
<ul>
<li>Understanding the needs of all stakeholders for HTA analytics, and where the use of R may best fit.</li>
<li>Promote the common goal of delivering HTA analytics work that meets those needs and efficiently utilizes R.</li>
<li>Become a central hub for connecting existing and new R initiatives in the HTA space, ensuring efficient and unified efforts.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Develop and Document Best Practices:
<ul>
<li>Develop and disseminate best practices for using R in HTA analytics work for clinical and economic evaluation.</li>
<li>Promote transparency and reproducibility in HTA analytics work.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Explore Pilot Studies with HTA authorities
<ul>
<li>Explore pilot studies to test and refine open source R-based tools and frameworks for clinical and economic evaluation.</li>
<li>Pursue collaborative efforts with HTA authorities to validate these tools, demonstrating their value in real-world HTA scenarios.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>If you think any of this is exciting and would like to become involved, please leave your name and email in <a href="https://github.com/RConsortium/HTA-wg/issues/1">issue number 1</a> at the HTA GitHub repository.</p>

<p>The R Consortium recently interviewed <a href="https://datascience.cct.arizona.edu/person/kristina-riemer">Kristina Riemer</a>, director of <a href="https://datascience.cct.arizona.edu/">the CCT Data Science Team</a> at the University of Arizona, and <a href="https://datascience.cct.arizona.edu/person/eric-scott">Eric Scott</a>, Scientific Programmer and Educator in the CCT Data Science Team, the developers behind the <a href="https://github.com/Meredith-Lab/volcalc">volcalc package</a>, to discuss the motivation and development of this innovative tool designed to automate the calculation of chemical compound volatilities. volcalc streamlines the process by allowing users to input a compound and quickly receive its volatility information, eliminating the need for time-consuming manual calculations. Initially created to assist <a href="https://has.arizona.edu/person/laura-meredith">Dr.&nbsp;Laura Meredith</a> in managing a large database of volatile compounds, volcalc has since grown into a more versatile tool under Eric’s leadership, now supporting a wider range of researchers.</p>
<p>Kristina and Eric share insights into the challenges they faced, including managing dependencies, integrating with CRAN and Bioconductor, and refining complex molecular identification methods. They also discuss future enhancements, such as incorporating temperature-specific volatility calculations and expanding the package’s functionality to estimate other compound characteristics. This project was funded by the R Consortium.</p>
<p><strong>Could you share what motivated the development of the volcalc package and how it aligns with the broader goals of the R ecosystem, particularly in scientific computing?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kristina</strong>: I was heavily involved in the initial development of volcalc, and later on, Eric took over the project. We developed volcalc because we began collaborating with Dr.&nbsp;Laura Meredith, who was compiling a database of volatile chemical compounds. At the time, she had around 300 compounds, and her students manually gathered details for each one by examining their representations and calculating various associated values. This process was tedious and prone to errors, so we thought there must be a more efficient and automated way to handle it.</p>
<p>That’s when we came up with the idea of creating a pipeline where someone could input a compound and quickly receive its volatility information, eliminating the need for all the manual labor. The purpose of volcalc was to transform the process from taking months to gather details for 300 compounds to obtaining information for thousands in a much shorter time.</p>
<p><strong>Eric</strong>: volcalc was initially developed specifically for a project where the researchers were mainly interested in chemical compounds from the <a href="https://www.genome.jp/kegg/">KEGG database (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes)</a>. When I joined the team and learned about the project, I was thrilled because, as a chemical ecologist, I saw its potential. However, I also recognized a limitation: the tool only worked with the KEGG database. This was a drawback because many researchers, including food scientists and others who work with similar compounds, might not find their compounds in that specific database.</p>
<p>This realization inspired me to apply for the R Consortium grant. We saw a significant opportunity to expand volcalc, making it more flexible and applicable to a wider range of researchers. We also wanted to improve its integration within the R ecosystem by adding features like returning the file path of a molecule representation after downloading it, so it could be easily piped into subsequent steps. These enhancements aimed to make the tool more versatile and user-friendly for a broader audience.</p>
<p><strong>What were the most significant challenges you faced during the development of the initial version of volcalc, and how did you overcome them?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kristina</strong>: One of the most challenging aspects of developing volcalc, which continues to be an issue, is managing dependencies. Specifically, we rely heavily on a command-line program to handle much of the processing. Early on, we struggled with how to enable users to run volcalc without needing to install this program on their own computers, as many of our users aren’t familiar with that kind of setup. I spent a lot of time trying to create a reproducible environment using <a href="https://mybinder.org/">Binder</a>, but I was never able to get it fully working. Even today, there are still issues related to managing these dependencies, which Eric can elaborate on further.</p>
<p>It was incredibly important to have Eric on this project because I don’t have a strong background in chemistry. His ability to come in and figure out some of the intricate details that would have taken me much longer to grasp was a huge advantage. The more we can collaborate with domain experts, the better our results will be.</p>
<p><strong>Eric</strong>: One thing that has helped with the dependency challenges is that we’ve started building volcalc on <a href="https://r-universe.dev/search">R-Universe</a>, which means binaries are available there. While it’s not on CRAN yet, having these binaries on R-Universe makes installation a bit easier. However, we’ve faced some challenges with dependencies, particularly because two of them are from Bioconductor. We didn’t originally aim to develop this package for Bioconductor, which uses S4 objects and has different standards than CRAN. Our goal was to get it on CRAN, but our first submission was rejected because the license field for the Bioconductor package wasn’t formatted to CRAN’s liking. These differences between Bioconductor and CRAN have created barriers, even though the authors of the Bioconductor package have been very responsive. Their package works fine on Bioconductor, but it doesn’t meet CRAN’s criteria, which has been a frustrating challenge.</p>
<p>Another major challenge in developing volcalc relates to the method we use for estimating volatility. This method involves counting the numbers of different functional groups on molecules—such as hydroxyl groups or sulfur atoms—and assigning coefficients to them. To do this programmatically, we use something called SMARTS, which is essentially like regular expressions but for molecular structures. Regular expressions for text are already challenging, but SMARTS is even more complex because it deals with three-dimensional molecules.</p>
<p>Before I joined the group, the first version of volcalc had most of these functional groups figured out, but not all. I spent a significant amount of time trying to develop SMARTS strings to match additional molecules. Moving forward, I hope that if we implement new versions, we can get help from the community to refine these SMARTS strings, as there are likely people out there who are more skilled at it than I am.</p>
<p><strong>The original project proposal mentions expanding volcalc to work with any chemical compound with a known structure. What are the key technical challenges you anticipate in achieving this goal?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Eric</strong>: This task turned out to be less difficult than I initially expected, but let me explain. In the original version of volcalc, before we received the R Consortium funding, the main function started with a KEGG ID—an identifier specific to the KEGG database. The function would download a MOL file, which is a text representation of a molecule corresponding to that ID. It would then identify and count the functional groups in the molecule, and finally, calculate the volatility based on those counts.</p>
<p>The major change we needed to implement to make volcalc more versatile was to decouple these steps. In the current version of volcalc, the functionality to download a MOL file from KEGG is still available, but it’s now separate from the main function that calculates volatility. This means that the inputs for calculating volatility can now be any MOL file, not just ones from KEGG. The file can come from any database, be exported from other software, or even be downloaded manually. Additionally, the tool now supports SMILES, which is another, simpler text-based representation of molecules.</p>
<p>There are various ways to represent chemicals in text, including another format called <a href="https://www.inchi-trust.org/">InChI.</a> The Bioconductor packages we use, ChemmineR and ChemmineOB, have the ability to translate from InChI and other types of chemical representations. However, that feature isn’t available on Windows. So, I decided to keep volcalc focused on SMILES and MOL files. I believe that chemists and other researchers should be able to obtain data in one of these two formats, or use another tool to translate their data into these formats. I didn’t want to overload volcalc with the responsibility of being a chemical representation translator, as that didn’t seem like its primary purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Can you walk us through the process of implementing the SIMPOL algorithm within the volcalcc package?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kristina</strong>: The algorithm itself is fairly simple; it’s just basic math. You need to input some constants, the mass of the compound, and the counts of the functional groups we discussed earlier. Writing the code for this was straightforward and not particularly challenging.</p>
<p><strong>Eric</strong>: Each functional group has a coefficient associated with it, which is multiplied by the number of times that group appears in the molecule. These values are then summed up, and the mass of the molecule is factored in as well. The challenging part wasn’t the algorithm itself, which is straightforward—just multiplying by coefficients and adding them up. The real difficulty was interpreting what the authors of the algorithm meant by each of the functional groups. Some were oddly specific, like how the hydroxyl group that is part of a nitrophenol group isn’t supposed to count toward the total number of hydroxyl groups. I spent a lot of time poring over the paper, particularly one table, to fully understand how they defined each group. That interpretation was the hardest part.</p>
<p><strong>What future functionalities or expansions do you see as crucial for volcalc, especially in the context of evolving research needs in chemoinformatics?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Eric</strong>: Right now, we’re working on allowing users to specify different temperatures. The paper that describes the SIMPOL.1 method includes equations for how the coefficients of each functional group change with temperature. These changes aren’t always linear, and the contributions of functional groups can shift in importance as the temperature varies. This is an important feature to include because the version of volcalc we currently have uses coefficients calculated at 20°C, based on a table from the original paper. To accommodate other temperatures, we need to integrate another table that provides equations for calculating these coefficients based on temperature, and that’s what we’re working on.</p>
<p>Another key feature we want to leave room for in the future is the ability to add other methods for estimating volatility. SIMPOL.1 is just one type of group contribution method, but there are other approaches described in various papers that use different functional groups, equations, and coefficients. The basic idea remains the same: count the functional groups in a molecule, apply an equation, and estimate volatility. We’re trying to structure the code in a way that makes it easy to incorporate additional methods later, even if we don’t add them right away. I think these are the most important features we’re focusing on right now.</p>
<p><strong>Kristina</strong>: We’re focused on the features I mentioned in the near future, but looking further ahead, I could see volcalc expanding to estimate other characteristics of compounds beyond just volatility. While I’m not a chemistry expert or a chemical ecologist, I imagine that those interested in volatility might also be interested in other compound characteristics that currently lack automated tools for estimation. So, it’s possible the package could evolve to include those features.</p>
<p>That said, one of the things I appreciate about the R package ecosystem is that it allows for specialized tools. Since anyone can build what they need, we don’t end up with massive, overly complex packages that try to do everything and become difficult to maintain. It might be better to keep volcalc focused and leave room for separate packages to handle additional functionality. This way, the tools remain manageable and easier to maintain in the long run.</p>
<p><strong>How has it been working with the R Consortium? Would you recommend applying for an ISC grant to other R developers?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kristina</strong>: The application process was straightforward, and I found the grant format to be very practical. It was focused on milestones and product development, which is refreshing compared to many academic research grants that tend to avoid specific deliverables. I highly recommend considering this grant. I believe people often overlook smaller funding sources, but even small amounts can make a big impact on the work you’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>Eric</strong>: The first time I applied for an R Consortium grant was as a grad student, and I strongly encourage trainees to apply as well. It was a great experience for me because I could do it independently—my advisor wasn’t involved as one of the authors, and it wasn’t a complex process like applying for an NSF grant. It was straightforward and really rewarding. The only tricky part was figuring out the payment process, but that’s something people can work out.</p>
<p>I’ve noticed there seem to be fewer projects in recent years, and I don’t think it’s due to a lack of funding. It seems like fewer people are applying, which is why I especially encourage others to give it a shot. From what I’ve seen, there’s a very good chance of getting funded if you apply right now.</p>
<p>People should be creative and think broadly about how their project can benefit the broader R community. This doesn’t mean you need to develop the next big thing like R-Universe or CRAN. It can be something smaller, like a package that other R users will find helpful. For example, with our project, volcalc, our main goal was to encourage chemists—who usually use point-and-click software—to start using R. That was enough of a contribution to the R community to get funded. So, I really encourage people to think creatively about what “benefiting the R community” can mean.</p>

  <title>Empowering Data Science: How R is Transforming Research in Cameroon</title>
  <dc:creator>R Consortium</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nyavoratovo/?originalSubdomain=cm">NyAvo RATOVO-ANDRIANARISOA</a>, the co-founder of the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/r-community-cameroon/">R Community Cameroon</a>, recently spoke with the R Consortium about the rapid growth of the R community in Cameroon and the impact of R on local research and data analysis. NyAvo provided insights into the community’s activities, such as developing an R community website using Shiny and implementing innovative projects like a custom search application. He also discussed the challenges and strategies in building a robust R ecosystem in Central Africa.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/empowering-data-science-how-r-is-transforming-research-in-cameroon/nyavo.jpg" class="img-fluid" style="width:50.0%"></p>
<p><strong>Please share your background and involvement with the RUGS group.</strong></p>
<p>I am a statistical engineer from the Institute of Statistics of Central Africa in Cameroon, originally from Madagascar. Currently, I serve in a monitoring and evaluation role with the United Nations. My journey with R began about five years ago as a student. I started learning R during my studies and expanded my expertise by freelancing as a <a href="https://shiny.posit.co/">Shiny</a> developer. Over time, I’ve also gained experience with OCR technology, working with Tesseract and utilizing Google Cloud Colab’s API Amazon Web services for R and artificial intelligence models.</p>
<p>With a solid statistical background, I specialize in data mining. In 2020, before learning about the R Consortium campaign, I had already envisioned creating an R community in Cameroon. After discussing the idea with some colleagues and discovering the potential support, it became the perfect opportunity to bring this vision to life. My colleagues and I officially launched the R Community Cameroon at the beginning of this year.</p>
<p>I would like to mention my colleagues who have co-founded the group with me: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/romain-tchakoute-916126170/">Romain TCHAKOUTE</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/idrissa-dabo-72a199118/">Idrissa DABO</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aboubacar-sa%C3%AFdou-boureima-0aa918203/">Saidou BOUREIMA</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mianala-anaelle-manambiravaka-8291aa260/">Mianala MANAMBIRAVAKA</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ndjiya-djeumen-luc-ronald-franck-8a5968221/">Ronald DJEUMEN.</a></p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/empowering-data-science-how-r-is-transforming-research-in-cameroon/community.webp" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><strong>Can you share what the R community is like in Cameroon?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cameroon is home to one of Central Africa’s largest science schools. I am part of a vibrant academic community of 30 members from several nationalities. This environment brings together some of the brightest minds, and R is an integral part of our curriculum. However, our use of R goes beyond basic statistics and plotting; we focus on more sophisticated applications, such as Monte Carlo estimation, model development, and advanced R programming.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/empowering-data-science-how-r-is-transforming-research-in-cameroon/school.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Several professors in our school possess strong statistical backgrounds and rely on R for their research. Additionally, our alums who have transitioned into the industry continue to leverage R for data analysis. While Cameroon has a limited amount of data, we conduct numerous surveys. The initial step most of us take is data cleaning, predominantly using R. Once the data is clean, we employ Quarto to generate automatic reports, allowing us to summarize survey results quickly. Some of my colleagues also explore other functionalities of R, like creating applications with R Shiny.</p>
<p>Another significant group is comprised of economics students or those working on their theses. They often seek our assistance to learn R for tasks such as descriptive statistics and building logistic models.</p>
<p><strong>Do you recommend any techniques for planning for or during the event? (Github, Zoom, other.) Can these techniques be used to make your group more inclusive to people unable to attend physical events in the future?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, we rely on <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/powerpoint">PowerPoint</a> to create posters for our events and <a href="https://meet.google.com/landing">Google Meet</a> for online meetings before having the Meetup Pro account provided by R Consortium. Many of us, the co-founders of the community, are technicians, so we also use Word for various tasks. However, leadership skills have been crucial in convincing people to join our vision. To engage others, we often organize dinner or lunchtime meetings. We’ve invested significant effort into these initiatives, and through them, we’ve successfully negotiated several partnerships. Initially, I contacted colleagues at the National Institute of Statistics to rally support for our cause.</p>
<p>Our community now includes students and academics, and some PhD doctors are still in the learning phase. I discussed creating a community in Cameroon, asking what value we could offer to encourage their participation. I proposed that they become co-founders of the community, a role they could highlight on their resumes. Seven people have already stepped up as leaders within our group.</p>
<p>We’re active both online and in person. It’s important to note that we organize two types of meetings. The first is an internal meeting with our community leaders, typically attended by around seven people. We use a WhatsApp group for communication and usually meet monthly for lunch at a restaurant for these meetings. The second activity involves larger groups. For these, we first coordinate with the administration, such as the school mentioned earlier, who then communicate with the students. We also document and share these activities online to inform others, though most of our communication is direct and specific.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/empowering-data-science-how-r-is-transforming-research-in-cameroon/meeting.webp" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>For example, after explaining our vision to a university contact, they were interested and agreed to offer a course at their institution. We then coordinated with the student body leader, planned a session, and shared the event online. We even hired a professional photographer to capture the event, sharing the photos with the school for further distribution. However, we haven’t yet posted about this activity on LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, we’re planning a session with another school—the statistical school where I studied. We’re currently in discussions with their management. Once we’ve had our conversation, possibly next week, we’ll talk with the student leaders. After the session, we plan to share our activities online, including photos, to highlight what we’re accomplishing in Cameroon.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/empowering-data-science-how-r-is-transforming-research-in-cameroon/students.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><strong>Do you have any upcoming events planned for the group?</strong></p>
<p>We have an upcoming event that I consider one of the most important we’ve planned. It is our group’s quarterly meeting. The main objective of this meeting is to develop our R community website using Shiny. It will be a workshop where we’ll gather in one place and form small groups comprising beginners and experienced members. During the workshop, we’ll collaborate to code and discuss ideas, and ideally, by the end of the session, we will have the code for our community website ready for deployment.</p>
<p>We’re currently facing some logistical challenges to organize this event. In Cameroon, when we organize events, we strive for perfection, ensuring everything from photography to visibility is top-notch. We’re searching for a suitable hotel venue to host our event.</p>
<p><strong>What trends do you currently see in R language and your industry?</strong></p>
<p>In Cameroon, <a href="https://quarto.org/">Quarto</a> is one of the most popular packages we promote during our R community sessions. Another widely used package is R Markdown. While I primarily use <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">R Markdown</a> to produce outputs for my job, I am also working on becoming more proficient with Quarto, as it is the future of reporting and documentation.</p>
<p>I frequently use the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse</a>, <a href="https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/">tidyr</a>, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/labelled/index.html">labelled</a>, and <a href="https://haven.tidyverse.org/">haven</a> suite of packages for data cleaning and reporting. A significant part of my job involves data cleaning, and I rely on tidyverse in conjunction with Quarto for these tasks.</p>
<p>We also utilize R for machine learning, though there is still potential for improvement in this area. We are focused on leveraging Shiny, Quarto, and tidyverse for our work.</p>
<p><strong>Please share about a project you are working on or have worked on using the R language. What is the goal/reason, result, or anything interesting, primarily related to your industry?</strong></p>
<p>We are currently working on an exciting project that is still in progress. The aim is to develop an application inspired by the functionality seen in the movie Fast and Furious, where users can search for information on the Internet. We are utilizing the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/index.html">httr</a> package to collect data from online sources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The application will enable users to input a search term, such as “lion in Cameroon,” and receive a dataset with all relevant information. Our goal is to provide high-quality data for researchers and other users, which involves considerable effort to ensure the accuracy and usefulness of the data.&nbsp;</p>

  <title>Thank You, Joseph Rickert: A Legacy of Leadership and Innovation in the R Community</title>
  <dc:creator>R Consortium</dc:creator>
  <link>https://r-consortium.org/posts/thank-you-joseph-rickert-a-legacy-of-leadership/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>As we announce the end of Joseph (Joe) Rickert’s tenure as the Executive Director of the R Consortium, we reflect on his remarkable contributions that have significantly contributed to the R community. Joe’s leadership has been instrumental in fostering growth, innovation, and collaboration within the R ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Founding the R Consortium</strong></p>
<p>Joe has been with the R Consortium since its inception in 2014. He was initially appointed to be Microsoft’s representative to the Infrastructure Steering Committee (ISC) and was soon tasked with creating the R User Groups (RUGS) grants program. Joe also pioneered the formation of ISC working groups to foster industry-wide collaborative projects. In 2016, Joe was appointed to be RStudio’s representative to the Board of Directors. In 2018, he took on the role of Secretary, and by 2019, he was elected Chair of the Board. In 2023, Joe took on the role of Executive Director. Under his guidance, the R Consortium has grown into an inclusive organization supporting the R programming language and its community. Our new executive director, Terry Christiani, was affirmed by the board of directors in our August 2024 board meeting after a selection committee interviewed candidates and made recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>Advancing User Groups</strong></p>
<p>One of Joe’s notable achievements is his unwavering support for R user groups worldwide. He recognized the importance of grassroots movements in spreading the use of R and provided essential resources and funding to these groups. He was instrumental in funding the R-Ladies as a top-level ISC project that operates worldwide to provide safe places for women to come together and learn from each other in an otherwise male-dominated space. Joe was also directly involved with the Bay Area useR Group (BARUG), organizing events, speaking, or contributing to discussions around the R programming language, especially in the context of data science and statistical computing. This support has enabled countless R enthusiasts to connect, share knowledge, and collaborate on projects, thereby strengthening the global R community.</p>
<p><strong>Industry Collaboration and Working Groups</strong></p>
<p>Joe actively reached out to industry leaders to create unique working groups aimed at solving industry-wide problems. These collaborations have led to the development of working groups focused on R programming solutions that benefit not only the community but also industries that rely on data science and statistical computing.</p>
<p><strong>A Legacy of Innovation</strong></p>
<p>Throughout his tenure, Joe has been a driving force behind numerous initiatives that have propelled the R community forward. His efforts have ensured that the R Consortium remains a dynamic and inclusive organization, fostering a spirit of collaboration and innovation. His leadership has left an indelible mark on the R community, and his legacy will continue to inspire future generations of R users and developers.</p>
<p>As we welcome new leadership, we extend our heartfelt gratitude to Joe Rickert for his dedication, vision, and tireless efforts in advancing the R community. Thank you, Joe, for your invaluable contributions and for paving the way for a brighter future for the R ecosystem.</p>

  <title>R-Ladies Bariloche in Argentina: Fostering a Different Approach to Leadership</title>
  <dc:creator>R Consortium</dc:creator>
  <link>https://r-consortium.org/posts/r-ladies-bariloche-in-argentina-fostering-a-different-approach/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/r-ladies-bariloche-in-argentina-fostering-a-different-approach/lina.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lina-moreno-azocar-81a5aa276/?originalSubdomain=ar">Lina Moreno</a>, founder and organizer of the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/es/rladies-bariloche/">R-Ladies Bariloche</a> chapter in Argentina, recently shared her journey with the R Consortium. A biologist focusing on evolutionary ecology, she discussed her experience building a local R community, the challenges of maintaining engagement post-pandemic, and her efforts to foster discussions on leadership and gender equity within academia. Through her work, she aims to create an inclusive space for women in data science and strengthen the R community in Bariloche.</p>
<p><strong>Please share your background and involvement with the RUGS group.</strong></p>
<p>I am a biologist working on evolutionary ecology, I did a bachelor in Sciences in another Argentinian province and then moved to Bariloche to start my PhD. (That was 16 years ago!) I spent a couple of years working in the field (I study reptiles, mainly lizards, and their adaptations to cold environments), and then I had to analyze the data. When I started my main analysis, I could only do it in R. At that time, my boss told me to start with R immediately, so I started searching online. I am doing this kind of work in my home country, so finding resources was complex. I had to work on a comparative analysis and phylogenies, which was difficult initially. However, I started studying and meeting people who taught me, which was awesome.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After several years, I encountered a problem I couldn’t resolve. I turned to Google and found a helpful community of ladies. They assisted me a lot and saved me from a tight spot. After some communication, they suggested starting an R-Ladies community in Bariloche. I met with them in person when I traveled to Buenos Aires. They convinced me to start a Bariloche chapter, and by the end of 2019, a few of my colleagues and I, mainly biologists working in the same area, created the Bariloche chapter.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/r-ladies-bariloche-in-argentina-fostering-a-different-approach/chapter.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><strong>What are some challenges you have faced in organizing this group?</strong></p>
<p>We are currently facing some difficulties as people seem unwilling to get involved. As a result, we are exploring new strategies such as combined meetups (online and in person), and together with other R-Ladies groups. We also plan to organize three or four meetups this year. Despite our efforts, we are getting discouraged by the lack of response, but we will see how it goes.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, there were five organizers, three of us with young children, so it was pretty difficult. We started a study group for the <a href="https://r4ds.hadley.nz/">R for Data Science</a> book, which had recently been translated into <a href="https://es.r4ds.hadley.nz/">Spanish</a>. We also organized meetups, mainly led by us. Surprisingly, there was good attendance during the pandemic, with around 40 people each time, similar to before the pandemic. However, after returning to in-person meetups, the attendance dropped significantly. The most crowded meetup had only 15 people, whereas before, we used to have two meetups on the same subject, both with 40 attendees.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/r-ladies-bariloche-in-argentina-fostering-a-different-approach/meetup.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>We are attempting to integrate virtual and in-person components, which has proven challenging. We aim to introduce a beginner’s course in R through a meetup to help attendees gain confidence for future meetups. Our meetups typically have a good turnout, but there is a lack of interest in specific topics, particularly those related to gender bias and women’s issues. Despite this, we are putting in a significant effort. Last year, we participated in a round table during a conference in Bariloche, focusing on gender bias and the difficulties of being a woman in Academia, and it received a lot of support, especially from women. The rest of the group is currently working on documenting our experience at that round table. I am not participating as I have been busy with other responsibilities.</p>
<p>Last year we surveyed people on how they feel R-Ladies is contributing to their careers, its influence on leadership abilities, their reasons for abandoning our events, or why they were too busy to attend. We have received some responses, but not as many as we expected.</p>
<p>However, we have enough data to write a paper about it. We’re also looking into the topic of leadership. We are opening our minds and exploring the possibilities of supporting the R community here in Bariloche, but it’s quite challenging at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>Can you share what the R community is like in Argentina?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The field of artificial intelligence and machine learning is rapidly evolving, which greatly helps incorporate knowledge in R. The leading software used for this purpose is R and Python. R is more popular than Python, as it has been around longer and is more user-friendly. Many people from academia with expertise in machine learning are transitioning to private industries. Regarding statistical analysis in biology, tools such as the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vegan/vegan.pdf">Vegan</a> package and those incorporating <a href="https://m-clark.github.io/generalized-additive-models/application.html">GAM (Generalized Additive Models)</a> are commonly used. Tools that can handle multiple effects simultaneously are in high demand in ecology.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/r-ladies-bariloche-in-argentina-fostering-a-different-approach/community.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><strong>Would you like to talk about any recent activity from the group?</strong></p>
<p>It was exciting what happened after the conference we participated in. As women, we are trying to maintain an open community. Initially, the organizers needed to learn how to manage an open group without a leader or a head, where everyone is considered equal. The participants ranged from students to established researchers, which ignited discussions about leadership and how women and minority groups navigate the world. We are accustomed to a robust and assertive leadership style, often associated with being at the top. However, as women, we wanted a different kind of leadership. This led to discussions on creating a new type of leadership that doesn’t adhere to the traditional patriarchal model. The manuscript the group is working on currently revolves around creating a new style of leadership that focuses on nurturing individuals to become better persons, researchers, or workers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The topics discussed in the manuscript revolve around how we can lead differently. These discussions were not limited to our group; we engaged with several groups from Argentina and Spain who also expressed a similar desire for a different kind of leadership. It is interesting to note that as women and minority groups, we want to be in positions to make meaningful decisions, especially given that our work as biologists primarily tackles environmental issues. Despite historically shying away from more traditional forms of leadership, we are now advocating for different styles. This shared sentiment has brought us closer to other minority groups, and we believe it’s an important topic that needs further discussion. It’s important to recognize that women have a different approach, and it doesn’t make us weaker than men; it simply signifies that we have a unique way of contributing.</p>

  <title>R4SocialScience: Empowering Social Science Research with R in India</title>
  <dc:creator>R Consortium</dc:creator>
  <link>https://r-consortium.org/posts/r4socialscience-empowering-social-science-research/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/drmohitgarg9/?trk=public_profile_browsemap&amp;originalSubdomain=in">Dr.&nbsp;Mohit Garg</a>, organizer of the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/r4socialscience/">R4SocialScience</a> group in Delhi, India recently talked to the R Consortium about his experience of starting an R user group. The R4SocialScience group aims to bridge the gap between social science research and data analysis, offering support and training to academics, researchers, and industry professionals. Dr.&nbsp;Garg shares his experiences, the growth of the R community in India, and his plans for expanding R’s reach.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/r4socialscience-empowering-social-science-research/drGarg.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><strong>Please share about your background and involvement with the RUGS group.</strong></p>
<p>I’m currently working as an assistant librarian at the <a href="https://home.iitd.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi</a>, one of the premier institutions in India.&nbsp; My academic background includes a BTech in Information Technology from Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University followed by an MS in Librarian Information Science from the <a href="https://www.isical.ac.in/">Indian Statistical Institute</a>, an institution dedicated to statistics in India started by the late Professor P.C. Mahanobis. After that, I completed my PhD in Library and Information Science from IGNOU, New Delhi.</p>
<p>My interest in R began in 2013 when I started my MS at the Indian Statistical Institute.&nbsp; Since then, I have taken various courses as part of my MS program and some online courses. I became interested in R due to its open source nature and the free availability of packages for all kinds of analysis. Then, I started promoting R in the academic community. However, in 2013, there was little interest in R because the prevalent approach in India was more focused on using commercial software for data analysis.&nbsp; However, in the past few years, there has been an increasing interest in R, with many workshops and government-funded events dedicated to it.</p>
<p>I have been providing R training to professors, teachers, and research scholars, and I have also worked on web-based development using <a href="https://shiny.posit.co/">Shiny</a> packages. Furthermore, we have developed a web dashboard to visualize real-time research productivity data obtained from sources like <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/products/scopus">Scopus</a> through API. Recently, we completed a 12-week MOOC course on <a href="https://swayam.gov.in/nc_details/NPTEL">NPTEL SWAYAM</a> platform with a focus solely on R. The course was quite popular, with 2584 learners from India joining, and 515 learners registering for the final examination. Although the course was free, participants had the option to pay for certification.</p>
<p><strong>Can you share what the R community is like in India?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been involved in the academic profession since 2016 and have been giving lectures and providing resource points at various institutions. I believe that there is a need to build a community focused on social sciences, especially for those who may have a limited understanding of mathematics, and statistics. The idea is to create a specific community related to social science, not just in India, but also in collaboration with other institutions. The community will cater to three main groups: those who are proficient in coding and development of R packages, those who are familiar with basic R but need further guidance, and those who are completely new to R.</p>
<p>The community aims to provide support for those interested in social science and to make R more accessible by offering packages related to social science, basic R tutorials. One specific package gaining popularity in academia is “<a href="https://www.bibliometrix.org/home/">biblo shiny bibliometrics</a>,” which facilitates scientific productivity mapping using R.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/r4socialscience-empowering-social-science-research/rSocialScience.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>We want to emphasize that R is not just a programming language, but a software for data analysis, to encourage more people to explore its potential. While both R and Python are interpreted languages, we aim to dispel the fear of programming and demonstrate how these languages can be used effectively. Although Python appears to be more widely used in the industry, there is still a growing interest in R.</p>
<p><strong>What are your plans for the group going forward?</strong></p>
<p>I have been teaching R for more than 10 years, and I found that researchers are interested in using R. I have identified three potential co-organizers from different regions in India to make a team of four people. We have already received a grant, and we plan to conduct training sessions in different locations across India.</p>
<p>I am focusing on a “train the trainer” model, where I aim to train individuals who can then carry out training sessions in their respective regions. India has over 50,000 colleges and around 1,200 universities, all involved in significant research and analysis activities. We also aim to have dedicated R trainers in all districts in India by 2026.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/r4socialscience-empowering-social-science-research/teaching.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Our approach involves dividing the country into five zones, followed by state-wise and district-wise planning. We are not heavily reliant on industry support, as our activities are primarily related to academia and research.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We plan to charge a nominal registration fee, which would cover expenses such as food and refreshment. We are hoping to minimize travel expenses, as they can be quite costly. But we will explore some way to fund the travel and accommodation expenses. We have hosted a one day workshop on “<a href="https://x.com/RConsortium/status/1808219594232156479">Doing Research using R</a>” at Galgotias University.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/r4socialscience-empowering-social-science-research/trainingSession.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>I am currently focusing on building a community and providing training sessions. I have noticed that online sessions may not be as effective as I had hoped, as participants seem to encounter many problems. Therefore, I am considering conducting more in-person workshops, which I believe will help popularize the training sessions. Additionally, I aim to develop specialized packages for social science and build a dedicated team. I am optimistic about these plans. During a recent workshop, I noticed that many participants preferred simple tools for data analysis. I intend to introduce such tools to make the training more accessible and user-friendly for participants. This is my vision for the community.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/r4socialscience-empowering-social-science-research/community.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><strong>Please share about a project you are currently working on or have worked on in the past using the R language. Goal/reason, result, anything interesting, especially related to the industry you work in?</strong></p>
<p>We have developed a platform utilizing the shiny and other text mining packages. This platform is still in the testing phase. The platform allows real-time data fetching from the Scopus API.</p>
<p>For example, if I search for a faculty member, it will display the publication data such as the number of publications, H-index, citations, types of publications, sources of publication, and annual publication distribution. We can also download this data.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/r4socialscience-empowering-social-science-research/platform.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>We have also developed a word cloud based on the titles of the publications for each faculty member, processed using the TM package. This helps to infer the expertise of the professors. Furthermore, we have included a feature for identifying the H-classic, which is related to the H-index.&nbsp; This platform is quite useful and efficient, especially for academic institutions. We now have the capability to download data from a specific date range as an Excel file. The data includes publication dates and the number of citations.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/r4socialscience-empowering-social-science-research/wordcloud.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>We’re in the process of creating a full dashboard for universities or institutions. We’ve also conducted a pilot study for other institutions. We are also considering publishing this work as a research paper to increase its visibility.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Pilot 3 test submission exemplifies an all-R submission package for ADaMs and TLFs, adhering to electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD) specifications. This comprehensive package not only includes ADaMs and TLGs, but it emulates a full study submission package including the source Study Data Tabulation Models (SDTMs) used to generate the Pilot 3 ADaMs. It also encompasses the installation and loading of the proprietary {pilot3utils} R package, various open-source R packages, R scripts for the Analysis Data Model (ADaM) datasets derived from Pilot 3, and Tables, Listings, and Figures (TLFs) from Pilot 1. In addition to other requisite eCTD components, the Pilot 3 package also includes the Analysis Data Reviewer’s Guide (ADRG) providing detailed steps leading to the execution of the analysis R scripts to re-produce the ADaMs and TLFs from a FDA reviewers perspective. These Pilot 3 submission materials are linked above.</p>
<p>Pilot 3 serves as a complement to Pilots <a href="https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot1-to-fda">1</a> and <a href="https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot2-to-fda">2</a>, which demonstrated the feasibility of submitting TLF R scripts and R Shiny code, respectively. Furthermore, Pilot 3 successfully validated the submission of proprietary R packages in compressed file formats, serving as another alternative to {pkglite} or installation directly from github.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about this Pilot 3 submission, we would love to hear from you. Feel free to submit any questions you may have as a <a href="https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot3-adam-to-fda/issues/new/choose">new issue</a> in our Pilot 3 github repository or you may find any of the Pilot 3 team members in <a href="https://pharmaverse.slack.com/archives/C030EB2M4GM">Pharmaverse slack</a>.</p>

<p>In the three pilots, for various TLFs, the working group members intentionally created different tables in different formats using various open-source R packages. The FDA staff successfully accepted and reproduced the results generated from these different open-source packages. However, though not in scope of these Pilots, we want to share awareness that sponsors are responsible for selecting open-source packages that demonstrate sufficient reliability. Further information on this can be found in the <a href="https://www.pharmar.org/">R Validation Hub</a>, formed in 2018 by the PSI AIMS Special Interest Group and supported by the R Consortium. It offers tools like <a href="https://www.pharmar.org/posts/news/updates-aug-2024/">{riskmetric}</a> to quantify the “risk” of R packages and a user-friendly R Shiny app, <a href="https://www.pharmar.org/riskassessment/">{riskassessment}</a>, to evaluate package reliability.</p>
<p>The majority of FDA staff feedback falls under the following themes :</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Clear ADRG documentation on computing environment, package dependencies, and expected warnings</li>
<li>Clear documentation on data processing rules and statistical method implementation</li>
<li>Good statistical practice in confirmatory trials, such as avoiding the possibility of “p-hacking”&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>For future submissions using open-source languages, it is recommended to give special attention to recommendation theme 1. Recommendation themes 2 and 3 are language-agnostic and should always be followed, regardless of the programming language used. All of these themes fall in line with the FDA’s <a href="https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-pilot3-adam/main/articles/statistical-software-clarifying-statement.html">Statistical Software Clarifying Statement</a>.</p>

<p>As a next step, the R Consortium R Submission Working Group initiated <a href="https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-pilot4/">submission pilot 4</a>, to explore the use of novel technologies such as Linux containers and web assembly to bundle a Shiny application into a self-contained package, facilitating a smoother process of both transferring and executing the application.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-wg/">R Consortium R Submissions Working Group</a> is focused on improving practices for R-based clinical trial regulatory submissions.</p>
<p>To bring an experimental clinical product to market, electronic submission of data, computer programs, and relevant documentation is required by health authority agencies from different countries. In the past, submissions have been mainly based on the SAS language.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In recent years, the use of open source languages, especially the R language, has become very popular in the pharmaceutical industry and research institutions. Although the health authorities accept submissions based on open source programming languages, sponsors may be hesitant to conduct submissions using open source languages due to a lack of working examples.</p>
<p>Therefore, the R Submissions Working Group aims at providing R-based submission examples and identifying potential gaps during submission of these example packages. All materials, including submission examples and communications, are publicly available on the R consortium Github page: <a href="https://github.com/RConsortium">https://github.com/RConsortium</a> .</p>
<p>The R consortium R submission working group includes members from more than 10 pharmaceutical companies, as well as regulatory agencies. More details of the working group can be found at: <a href="https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-wg/">https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-wg/</a> .</p>
<p>The R consortium R submission working group is open to anyone who is interested in joining. If interested, please contact Joseph Rickert at director@r-consortium.org.&nbsp;</p>
